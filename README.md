# Binding data and perform action in ej2 javascript grid using Fetch request

This repository demonstrates the integration of the Syncfusion EJ2 Grid with external data sources using Fetch requests. The Syncfusion Grid provides a seamless way to bind data from external sources, facilitating CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations with data retrieved from a server. This feature is particularly valuable for sending data to a server for database updates and asynchronously retrieving data without refreshing the entire web page.

**CRUD Operations:** Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations.
